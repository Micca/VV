% EXERCISE3 applies filters of excercise 3 on image sequence.
%
%   EXERCISE3(INPUT_DIRECTORY, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY) reads all files in
%   the INPUT_DIRECTORIES with the name frameXXXX.png and applies the 
%   implemented filters on these images. The finally processed frames 
%   are stored in OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.
%
%   EXERCISE3({INPUT_DIRECTORY1, INPUT_DIRECTORY2}, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY) reads
%   first all files in the INPUT_DIRECTORY1 and then all files in the
%   INPUT_DIRECTORY2 with the name frameXXXX.png and applies the 
%   implemented filters on these images. The finally processed frames 
%   are stored in OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.
%
%   EXERCISE3(INPUT_DIRECTORY, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, START_FRAME, END_FRAME) only
%   processes the images from START_FRAME to END_FRAME.
%
% Example 1:
%   EXERCISE3('../images', '../output') processes all images frameXXXX.png in 
%   '../images' and stores the output in '../output'.
%
% Example 2:
%   EXERCISE3('../images', '../output', 1, 25) processes only frames 1 to 25.
%
% Example 3:
%   EXERCISE3({'../images1','../images2'}, '../output') reads all images from
%   2 input directories '../images1' and '../images2' (in this order) and 
%   applies the filters on all images.
